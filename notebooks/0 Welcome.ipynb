    "Hi there. This is a **Jupyter notebook**. Notebooks allow you to combine text and code into nice little presentations. This is handy for demos, reports, lessons, or any other time you want to explain (or show off) your code. Jupyter notebooks will be my primary way of sharing coding lessons with you.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Python is readable and user-friendly.\n",
    "- Python has lots of open source support. Most of the tools you need have already been developed in Python.\n",
    "- Python is incredibly easy to set up on your computer.\n",
    "- More and more code is being written in Python.\n",

This loosely corresponds to any piece of software that let's you write code and test it. There are many IDEs available for Python, but we'll use IDLE because it's simple and approachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aside:** You may have asked yourself, what does it mean to install Python, exactly? While Python is a programming language, the computer needs a way to translate that language to machine code (instructions the computer can read). Python *the program* is used to translate Python *the language* to machine code.\n",
